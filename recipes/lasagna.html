    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
    <li>
      Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil,
      1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring
      occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
      Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
      To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
      lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of
      the mozzarella cheese slices. Spool 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan
      cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
      spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
